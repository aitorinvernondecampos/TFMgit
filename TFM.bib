            The increasing availability of multidimensional phenotypic data in large cohorts of genotyped individuals requires efficient methods to identify genetic effects on multiple traits. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) offers a powerful non-parametric approach. However, it relies on permutations to assess significance, which hinders the analysis of large datasets. Here, we derive the limiting null distribution of the PERMANOVA test statistic, providing a framework for the fast computation of asymptotic
            p
            values. We show that the asymptotic test presents controlled type I error and high power, comparable to or higher than parametric approaches. We illustrate the applicability of our method in a number of use-cases. Using the GTEx cohort, we perform the first population-biased splicing QTL mapping study across multiple tissues. We identify thousands of genetic variants that affect alternative splicing differently depending on ethnicity, including potential disease markers. Using the UK Biobank cohort, we perform the largest GWAS to date of MRI-derived volumes of hippocampal subfields. Most of the identified loci have not been previously related to the hippocampus, but many are associated to cognition or brain disorders, thus contributing to understand the intermediate traits through which genetic variants impact complex organismal phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental step in eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis. Here, we develop an efficient and reproducible pipeline for the discovery of genetic variants that affect AS (splicing QTLs, sQTLs). We use it to analyze the GTEx dataset, generating a comprehensive catalog of sQTLs in the human genome. Downstream analysis of this catalog provides insight into the mechanisms underlying splicing regulation. We report that a core set of sQTLs is shared across multiple tissues. sQTLs often target the global splicing pattern of genes, rather than individual splicing events. Many also affect the expression of the same or other genes, uncovering regulatory loci that act through different mechanisms. sQTLs tend to be located in post-transcriptionally spliced introns, which would function as hotspots for splicing regulation. While many variants affect splicing patterns by altering the sequence of splice sites, many more modify the binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Genetic variants affecting splicing can have a stronger phenotypic impact than those affecting gene expression.},

	abstract = {Identification of genetic variants affecting splicing in RNA sequencing population studies is still in its infancy. Splicing phenotype is more complex than gene expression and ought to be treated as a multivariate phenotype to be recapitulated completely. Here we represent the splicing pattern of a gene as the distribution of the relative abundances of a gene's alternative transcript isoforms. We develop a statistical framework that uses a distance-based approach to compute the variability of splicing ratios across observations, and a non-parametric analogue to multivariate analysis of variance. We implement this approach in the R package sQTLseekeR and use it to analyze RNA-Seq data from the Geuvadis project in 465 individuals. We identify hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), including some falling in genome-wide association study SNPs. By developing the appropriate metrics, we show that sQTLseekeR compares favorably with existing methods that rely on univariate approaches, predicting variants that behave as expected from mutations affecting splicing.},

@article{anderson_new_2001,
	abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

@article{anderson_generalized_2003,
	abstract = {This paper describes a method of generalized discriminant analysis based on a dissimilarity matrix to test for differences in a priori groups of multivariate observations. Use of classical multidimensional scaling produces a low-dimensional representation of the data for which Euclidean distances approximate the original dissimilarities. The resulting scores are then analysed using discriminant analysis, giving tests based on the canonical correlations. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics under permutations of the observations are shown to be invariant to changes in the distributions of the original variables, unlike the distributions of the multi-response permutation test statistics which have been considered by other workers for testing differences among groups. This canonical method is applied to multivariate fish assemblage data, with Monte Carlo simulations to make power comparisons and to compare theoretical results and empirical distributions. The paper proposes classification based on distances. Error rates are estimated using cross-validation.},

@article{hoffmann_archaea_2013,
	abstract = {Diet influences health as a source of nutrients and toxins, and by shaping the composition of resident microbial populations. Previous studies have begun to map out associations between diet and the bacteria and viruses of the human gut microbiome. Here we investigate associations of diet with fungal and archaeal populations, taking advantage of samples from 98 well-characterized individuals. Diet was quantified using inventories scoring both long-term and recent diet, and archaea and fungi were characterized by deep sequencing of marker genes in DNA purified from stool. For fungi, we found 66 genera, with generally mutually exclusive presence of either the phyla Ascomycota or Basiodiomycota. For archaea, Methanobrevibacter was the most prevalent genus, present in 30\% of samples. Several other archaeal genera were detected in lower abundance and frequency. Myriad associations were detected for fungi and archaea with diet, with each other, and with bacterial lineages. Methanobrevibacter and Candida were positively associated with diets high in carbohydrates, but negatively with diets high in amino acids, protein, and fatty acids. A previous study emphasized that bacterial population structure was associated primarily with long-term diet, but high Candida abundance was most strongly associated with the recent consumption of carbohydrates. Methobrevibacter abundance was associated with both long term and recent consumption of carbohydrates. These results confirm earlier targeted studies and provide a host of new associations to consider in modeling the effects of diet on the gut microbiome and human health.},

Computational Statistics \& Data Analysis 53, 853--856] proposed a chi-square approximation to the distribution of non-negative definite quadratic forms in non-central normal variables. To approximate the distribution of interest, they used a non-central chi-square distribution, where the degrees of freedom and the non-centrality parameter were calculated using the first four cumulants of the quadratic form. Numerical examples were encouraging, suggesting that the approximation was particularly accurate in the upper tail of the distribution. We present here additional empirical evidence, comparing Liu--Tang--Zhang's four-moment non-central chi-square approximation with exact methods. While the moment-based method is interesting because of its simplicity, we demonstrate that it should be used with care in practical work, since numerical examples suggest that significant differences may occur between that method and exact methods, even in the upper tail of the distribution.},

	abstract = {Most genetic variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans are noncoding, indicating their role in gene regulation. Previous studies have shown considerable links of GWAS signals to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) but the links to other genetic regulatory mechanisms, such as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), are underexplored. Here, we introduce an sQTL mapping method, testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects (THISTLE), with improved power over competing methods. Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8, approximately 61\% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61\% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation.},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here. ({\copyright} 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

@article{stephens_unified_2013,
	abstract = {We consider the problem of assessing associations between multiple related outcome variables, and a single explanatory variable of interest. This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations -- that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5--10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data.},

@phdthesis{casale_multivariate_2016,
	abstract = {In the last decade, genome-wide association studies have helped to advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of many important traits, including diseases. However, the statistical analysis of genotype-phenotype associations remains challenging due to multiple factors. First, many traits have polygenic architectures, which means that they are controlled by a large number of variants with small individual effects. Second, as increasingly deep phenotype data are being generated there is a need for multivariate analysis approaches to leverage multiple related phenotypes while retaining computational efficiency. Additionally, genetic analyses are confronted by strong confounding factors that can create spurious associations when not properly accounted for in the statistical model. We here derive more flexible methods that allow integrating genetic effects across variants and multiple quantitative traits. To do so, we build on the classical linear mixed model (LMM), a widely adopted framework for genetic studies.

The first contribution of this thesis is mtSet, an efficient mixed-model approach that enables genome-wide association testing between sets of genetic variants and multiple traits while accounting for confounding factors. In both simulations and real-data applications we demonstrate that mtSet effectively combines the advantages of variant-set and multi-trait analyses.

Next, we present a new model for gene-context interactions that builds on mtSet. The proposed interaction set test (iSet) yields increased statistical power for detecting polygenic interactions. Additionally, iSet enables the identification of genetic loci that are associated with different configurations of causal variants across contexts. After benchmarking the proposed method using simulated data, we consider two applications to real datasets, where we investigate genetic effects on gene expression across different cellular contexts and sex-specific genetic effects on lipid levels.

Finally, we describe LIMIX, a software framework for the flexible implementation of different LMMs. Most of the models considered in this thesis, including mtSet and iSet, are implemented and available in LIMIX. A unique aspect of the software is an inference framework that allows a large class of genetic models to be defined and, in many cases, to be efficiently fitted by exploiting specific algebraic properties. We demonstrate the utility of this software suite in two applied collaboration projects.

Taken together, this thesis demonstrates the value of flexible and integrative modelling in genetics and contributes new statistical methods for genetic analysis. These approaches generalise previous models, yet retain the computational efficiency that is needed to tackle large genetic datasets.},

	abstract = {We have developed an efficient and reproducible pipeline for the identification of genetic variants affecting splicing (splicing quantitative trait loci or sQTLs), based on an approach that captures the intrinsically multivariate nature of this phenomenon. We employed it to study the multi-tissue transcriptome GTEx dataset, generating a comprehensive catalogue of sQTLs in the human genome. Downstream analyses of this catalogue provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying alternative splicing regulation and its contribution to human complex traits and diseases. To facilitate the visualization of splicing events in GTEx and other large-scale RNA-seq studies, we developed a software to generate sashimi plots, which supports the aggregated representation of hundreds of samples. Given the growing interest in efficient methods to identify genetic effects on multiple traits, we extended the statistical framework employed for sQTL mapping (Anderson test) to accommodate any quantitative multivariate phenotype and experimental design. We derived the limiting distribution of the test statistic, allowing to compute asymptotic p values. We further demonstrated the advantages and applicability of our approach to GWAS and QTL mapping analyses using simulated and real datasets.},

With the increasing availability of genome-wide association study summary statistics, as well as the establishment of deeply phenotyped sample collections, it is now possible to systematically assess the genetic overlap between multiple traits and diseases. In addition to increasing power to detect associated variants, multi-trait methods can also aid our understanding of how different disorders are aetiologically linked by highlighting relevant biological pathways. A plethora of available tools to perform such analyses exists, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this review, we outline some of the currently available methods to conduct multi-trait analyses. First, we briefly introduce the concept of pleiotropy and outline the current landscape of pleiotropy research in human genetics; second, we describe analytical considerations and analysis methods; finally, we discuss future directions for the field.},

@article{guo_integrate_2019,
	abstract = {Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data.Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test.All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2‚Äâmin to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Es equivalente a encontrar un resultado falso positivo, porque el investigador llega a la conclusi{\'o}n de que existe una diferencia entre las hip{\'o}tesis cuando en realidad no existe. Se relaciona con el nivel de significancia estad{\'\i}stica.

   aqu{\'\i} es el supuesto de que la situaci{\'o}n experimental presentar{\'\i}a un ¬´estado normal¬ª. Si no se advierte este ¬´estado normal¬ª, aunque en realidad existe, se trata de un error estad{\'\i}stico tipo I. Algunos ejemplos para el error tipo I ser{\'\i}an:

Se considera que el paciente est{\'a} enfermo, a pesar de que en realidad est{\'a} sano; hip{\'o}tesis nula: El paciente est{\'a} sano.
Se declara culpable al acusado, a pesar de que en realidad es inocente; hip{\'o}tesis nula: El acusado es inocente.
No se permite el ingreso de una persona, a pesar de que tiene derecho a ingresar; hip{\'o}tesis nula: La persona tiene derecho a ingresar.En un estudio de investigaci{\'o}n, el error de tipo II, tambi{\'e}n llamado error de tipo beta (Œ≤) (Œ≤ es la probabilidad de que exista este error) o falso negativo, se comete cuando el investigador no rechaza la hip{\'o}tesis nula siendo esta falsa en la poblaci{\'o}n. Es equivalente a la probabilidad de un resultado falso negativo, ya que el investigador llega a la conclusi{\'o}n de que ha sido incapaz de encontrar una diferencia que existe en la realidad.
De forma general y dependiendo de cada caso, se suele aceptar en un estudio que el valor del error beta est{\'e} entre el 5 y el 20\%.[cita requerida]Contrariamente al error tipo I, en la mayor{\'\i}a de los casos no es posible calcular la probabilidad del error tipo II. La raz{\'o}n de esto se encuentra en la manera en que se formulan las hip{\'o}tesis en una prueba estad{\'\i}stica.

Most multi-trait analysis methods focus on individual common variants in genome-wide association studies. Here, we introduce multi-trait analysis of rare-variant associations (MTAR), a framework for joint analysis of association summary statistics between multiple rare variants and different traits. MTAR achieves substantial power gain by leveraging the genome-wide genetic correlation measure to inform the degree of gene-level effect heterogeneity across traits. We apply MTAR to rare-variant summary statistics for three lipid traits in the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. 99 genome-wide significant genes were identified in the single-trait-based tests, and MTAR increases this to 139. Among the 11 novel lipid-associated genes discovered by MTAR, 7 are replicated in an independent UK Biobank GWAS analysis. Our study demonstrates that MTAR is substantially more powerful than single-trait-based tests and highlights the value of MTAR for novel gene discovery.},

This has proven challenging for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Due to the distributed nature of genetic signal across brain regions, multivariate analysis of regional measures may enhance discovery of genetic variants. Current multivariate approaches to GWAS are ill-suited for complex, large-scale data of this kind. Here, we introduce the Multivariate Omnibus Statistical Test (MOSTest), with an efficient computational design enabling rapid and reliable inference, and apply it to 171 regional brain morphology measures from 26,502 UK Biobank participants. At the conventional genome-wide significance threshold of Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí8, MOSTest identifies 347 genomic loci associated with regional brain morphology, more than any previous study, improving upon the discovery of established GWAS approaches more than threefold.

The recent application of GWAS to clinic-based cohorts has also yielded genetic predictors of clinical outcomes. Regardless of context, the practical utility of this information will ultimately depend upon the quality of the original data. Quality control (QC) procedures for GWAS are computationally intensive, operationally challenging, and constantly evolving. With each new dataset, new realities are discovered about GWAS data and best practices continue to be developed. The Genomics Workgroup of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) funded electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network has invested considerable effort in developing strategies for QC of these data. The lessons learned by this group will be valuable for other investigators dealing with large scale genomic datasets. Here we enumerate some of the challenges in QC of GWAS data and describe the approaches that the eMERGE network is using for quality assurance in GWAS data, thereby minimizing potential bias and error in GWAS results. In this protocol we discuss common issues associated with QC of GWAS data, including data file formats, software packages for data manipulation and analysis, sex chromosome anomalies, sample identity, sample relatedness, population substructure, batch effects, and marker quality. We propose best practices and discuss areas of ongoing and future research.},

@misc{noauthor_genome-wide_2023,
	abstract = {In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.
GWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.The first successful GWAS published in 2002 studied myocardial infarction. This study design was then implemented in the landmark GWA 2005 study investigating patients with age-related macular degeneration, and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. As of 2017, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found. Except in the case of rare genetic diseases, these associations are very weak, but while they may not explain much of the risk, they provide insight into genes and pathways that can be important.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs contributes to transcriptome diversity and enables plants to generate different protein isoforms from a single gene and/or fine-tune gene expression during different development stages and environmental changes. Although AS is pervasive, the genetic basis for differential isoform usage in plants is still emerging. In this study, we performed genome-wide analysis in 666 geographically distributed diverse ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genomic regions [splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs)] that may regulate differential AS. These ecotypes belong to different microclimatic conditions and are part of the relict and non-relict populations. Although sQTLs were spread across the genome, we observed enrichment for trans-sQTL (trans-sQTLs hotspots) on chromosome one. Furthermore, we identified several sQTL (911) that co-localized with trait-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified in the Arabidopsis genome-wide association studies (AraGWAS). Many sQTLs were enriched among circadian clock, flowering, and stress-responsive genes, suggesting a role for differential isoform usage in regulating these important processes in diverse ecotypes of Arabidopsis. In conclusion, the current study provides a deep insight into SNPs affecting isoform ratios/genes and facilitates a better mechanistic understanding of trait-associated SNPs in GWAS studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of sQTL analysis in a large set of Arabidopsis ecotypes and can be used as a reference to perform sQTL analysis in the Brassicaceae family. Since whole genome and transcriptome datasets are available for these diverse ecotypes, it could serve as a powerful resource for the biological interpretation of trait-associated loci, splice isoform ratios, and their phenotypic consequences to help produce more resilient and high yield crop varieties.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the genetic variation underlying transcript splicing is essential to dissect the molecular mechanisms of common disease. The available evidence from splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) studies has been limited to small samples. We performed genome-wide screening to identify SNPs that might control mRNA splicing in whole blood collected from 5,257 Framingham Heart Study participants. We identified 572,333 cis sQTLs involving 2,650 unique genes. Many sQTL-associated genes (40\%) undergo alternative splicing. Using the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog, we determined that 528 unique sQTLs were significantly enriched for 8,845 SNPs associated with traits in previous GWAS. In particular, we found 395 (4.5\%) GWAS SNPs with evidence of cis sQTLs but not gene-level cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), suggesting that sQTL analysis could provide additional insights into the functional mechanism underlying GWAS results. Our findings provide an informative sQTL resource for further characterizing the potential functional roles of SNPs that control transcript isoforms relevant to common diseases.},

	abstract = {Detailed analyses of transcriptome have revealed complexity in regulation of alternative splicing (AS). These AS events often undergo modulation by genetic variants. Here we analyse RNA-sequencing data of prefrontal cortex from 206 individuals in combination with their genotypes and identify cis-acting splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) throughout the genome. These sQTLs are enriched among exonic and H3K4me3-marked regions. Moreover, we observe significant enrichment of sQTLs among disease-associated loci identified by GWAS, especially in schizophrenia risk loci. Closer examination of each schizophrenia-associated loci revealed four regions (each encompasses NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 or APOPT1), where the index SNP in GWAS is in strong linkage disequilibrium with sQTL SNP(s), suggesting dysregulation of AS as the underlying mechanism of the association signal. Our study provides an informative resource of sQTL SNPs in the human brain, which can facilitate understanding of the genetic architecture of complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia., Alternative splicing of mRNAs occurs in tissue specific manners and may be modulated by genetic variations. Here, Takata and colleagues perform splicing quantitative trait loci analysis (sQTL) of human brain and show significant enrichment of sQTLs among neurological disease-associated loci.},

@article{ongen_alternative_2015,
	abstract = {With the advent of RNA-sequencing technology, we can detect different types of alternative splicing and determine how DNA variation regulates splicing. However, given the short read lengths used in most population-based RNA-sequencing experiments, quantifying transcripts accurately remains a challenge. Here we present a method, Altrans, for discovery of alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (asQTLs). To assess the performance of Altrans, we compared it to Cufflinks and MISO in simulations and Cufflinks for asQTL discovery. Simulations show that in the presence of unannotated transcripts, Altrans performs better in quantifications than Cufflinks and MISO. We have applied Altrans and Cufflinks to the Geuvadis dataset, which comprises samples from European and African populations, and discovered (FDR = 1\%) 1,427 and 166 asQTLs with Altrans and 1,737 and 304 asQTLs with Cufflinks for Europeans and Africans, respectively. We show that, by discovering a set of asQTLs in a smaller subset of European samples and replicating these in the remaining larger subset of Europeans, both methods achieve similar replication levels (95\% for both methods). We find many Altrans-specific asQTLs, which replicate to a high degree (93\%). This is mainly due to junctions absent from the annotations and hence not tested with Cufflinks. The asQTLs are significantly enriched for biochemically active regions of the genome, functional marks, and variants in splicing regions, highlighting their biological relevance. We present an approach for discovering asQTLs that is a more direct assessment of splicing compared to other methods and is complementary to other transcript quantification methods.},

	abstract = {AFLP-PCR or just AFLP is a PCR-based tool used in genetics research, DNA fingerprinting, and in the practice of genetic engineering. Developed in the early 1990s by KeyGene, AFLP uses restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA, followed by ligation of adaptors to the sticky ends of the restriction fragments. A subset of the restriction fragments is then selected to be amplified. This selection is achieved by using primers complementary to the adaptor sequence, the restriction site sequence and a few nucleotides inside the restriction site fragments (as described in detail below). The amplified fragments are separated and visualized on denaturing on agarose gel electrophoresis , either through autoradiography or fluorescence methodologies, or via automated capillary sequencing instruments.
Although AFLP should not be used as an acronym, it is commonly referred to as "Amplified fragment length polymorphism". However, the resulting data are not scored as length polymorphisms, but instead as presence-absence polymorphisms.AFLP-PCR is a highly sensitive method for detecting polymorphisms in DNA. The technique was originally described by Vos and Zabeau in 1993. In detail, the procedure of this technique is divided into three steps:

Digestion of total cellular DNA with one or more restriction enzymes and ligation of restriction half-site specific adaptors to all restriction fragments.
Selective amplification of some of these fragments with two PCR primers that have corresponding adaptor and restriction site specific sequences.
Electrophoretic separation of amplicons on a gel matrix, followed by visualisation of the band pattern.},
